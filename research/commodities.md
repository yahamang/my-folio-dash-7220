### Copper (HG=F)
- **Demand drivers**: AI data center cooling / power wiring, EV batteries & wiring harnesses, renewables buildout
- **Supply**: Mine disruptions in Chile / Peru (political instability)
- **Key variable**: China PMI — China accounts for >50% of global copper demand
- **Entry trigger**: Enter after China manufacturing PMI confirms >50

### Uranium (URA ETF)
- **Demand drivers**: European energy security → nuclear restarts; AI power demand → SMR pipeline
- **Supply**: Kazatomprom production adjustments; Western supply chain reshoring
- **URA holdings**: Cameco (Canada), Kazatomprom, NexGen Energy, etc.

## Monitoring Dashboard

| Indicator | Reference Level | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| DXY (USD Index) | <100 → gold bullish | USD weakens = gold more attractive |
| China PMI | >50 → copper bullish | China recovery = copper demand rises |
| US 10yr yield | <4% → gold favorable | Lower real rates = lower gold opportunity cost |
| VIX | >30 → buy gold | Fear spike = safe-haven inflows |
| Uranium spot | >$70/lb sustained | Above miner cash cost = stable supply incentive |
