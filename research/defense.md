## Investment Thesis
NATO 2% GDP defense spending mandate + prolonged Ukraine conflict + Middle East tensions →
structural growth in Korean K-defense exports (cost-competitive + reliable delivery). Lee
administration maintains export support policy.

## Watchlist

| Name | Ticker | Products | Key Export Contracts |
|------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Hanwha Aerospace | 012450.KS | K9 howitzer, aircraft engines | Poland, Romania, Egypt |
| Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) | 047810.KS | FA-50, T-50 | Malaysia, Poland, Iraq |
| Hyundai Rotem | 064350.KS | K2 MBT, hydrogen trains | Poland Phase 2 & 3 contracts |
| LIG Nex1 | — | Guided weapons, radar | Middle East, Southeast Asia |

## Monitoring Indicators
- Poland Phase 2 contract signing (K2 MBT ×820, K9 howitzer ×672 target)
- NATO member defense budget disbursements
- KRW/USD rate (contracts denominated in USD)
- Export contract disclosures (track quarterly)

## Entry Strategy
- Small target weight (5%) → concentrate in 1–2 names
- Hanwha Aerospace: most diversified export base; preferred core holding
- Hyundai Rotem: event-driven trade on Poland contract progress
- Event-driven approach preferred over dollar-cost averaging

## Risk Factors
- Contract delays or cancellations (political negotiation risk)
- Ukraine ceasefire → reduction in urgent demand
- KRW appreciation → export margin erosion
- Payment collection delays inherent in large defense contracts

## Interpretation Guide
- **Order backlog / revenue ratio**: Higher = better forward earnings visibility
- **Export revenue mix**: Higher overseas share = superior growth profile
- **FX sensitivity**: Track KRW/USD for margin impact on contract value
