## Investment Thesis
Commercial Act amendments (1st & 2nd rounds complete, 3rd round pending — mandatory treasury share
cancellation) → director fiduciary duty extended to all shareholders → pressure for higher dividends
and buyback cancellations → re-rating of chronically cheap Korean conglomerates and banks
(Korea Discount narrowing). KOSPI 5,000 achieved; policy tailwind intact toward 6,000 target.

## Watchlist

| Name | Ticker | PBR (ref.) | Key Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Shinhan Financial Group | 055550.KS | ~0.6 | Improving ROE trend, dividend expansion policy |
| KB Financial Group | 105560.KS | ~0.6 | Leads buyback cancellation, Value-up Index inclusion |
| Hana Financial Group | 086790.KS | ~0.5 | Lowest PBR among majors, value-up pioneer |
| Meritz Financial Group | 138040.KS | — | Aggressive capital return policy |
| Samsung C&T | 028260.KS | — | Holding-company discount reversal, large treasury stock |

## Policy Monitoring (Critical)

| Event | Checkpoint | Upside Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Commercial Act 3rd amendment passes | Mandatory cancellation of treasury shares within 1 year | ★★★ |
| Value-up Index expansion | Additional inclusions announced | ★★ |
| NPS stewardship strengthening | Increased dividend / buyback pressure | ★★ |
| Commercial Act 2nd amendment effective (2026-09-10) | Cumulative voting, separate audit committee vote | ★★ |

## Entry Strategy
- **Priority 1**: Buy after Commercial Act 3rd amendment confirmed (catalyst-driven)
- **Priority 2**: Short-term momentum trade around dividend expansion announcements
- Screen for PBR <0.5× + ROE >8% combination
- Consider entry within days of buyback / cancellation announcements

## Risk Factors
- Commercial Act 3rd amendment delayed or watered down → price reversal
- Economic slowdown → rising NPLs at banks (NIM compression)
- Rate cuts → spread compression (bank earnings headwind)
- Political risk: policy continuity uncertain if administration changes

## Interpretation Guide
- **PBR <0.5**: Trading below liquidation value → structural undervaluation
- **High treasury stock ratio**: Mandatory cancellation directly boosts per-share value
- **High ROE + low PBR**: Best buy candidate combination (value + quality)
