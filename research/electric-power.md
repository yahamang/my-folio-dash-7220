## Investment Thesis
Global AI data center buildout → structural surge in power demand → transformers, cables, and
switchgear in a multi-year upcycle. Korea benefits from: aging grid replacement, the Lee Jae-myung
government's "West Sea Energy Highway" policy, and a nuclear renaissance.

## Entry Checklist
- [ ] KOSPI pullback ≥5% → consider staged buying (1/3 → 1/3 → 1/3)
- [ ] PER ≤15× or price near 52-week low → preferred entry
- [ ] Allocate portion of deposit maturity proceeds (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Monitor price reaction within 3 days of major order disclosure

## Monitoring Indicators
- US power infrastructure capex (FERC, DOE announcements)
- AI data center power contract sizes (big-tech quarterly earnings calls)
- Copper price (HG=F) — direct impact on cable COGS
- KRW/USD exchange rate — export margin sensitivity

## Risk Factors
- US–China trade friction / export controls (US-bound equipment risk)
- KRW appreciation hurts export profitability
- Price run-up ahead of order wins (valuation risk)
- Competition from global majors (ABB, Siemens, Hitachi)

## Reference Sources
- KEPCO capex plans (quarterly disclosures)
- 10th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand
